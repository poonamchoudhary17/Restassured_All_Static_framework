# Restassured_All_Static_framework
This framework project is created to automate the REST API of any type of methods. 
This project is designed to automate various types of APIs, including SOAP and REST, primarily utilizing RestAssured, Apache POI, TestNG, and JSONPath.
Key features of the project include:
1)Automation of execution and validation of REST methods such as POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and GET, as well as SOAP methods.
2)Ability to construct request bodies using parameters extracted from an Excel file. The project includes a utility built with Apache POI for  data retrieval from Excel.
3)Implementation of data-driven and keyword-driven concepts, dividing the project into four packages: "api method," "request repository," "test classes," and "static driver classes."
4)Test execution driven by static driver classes, allowing for individual execution of tests.
5)Capturing and saving evidence of execution into text files, which contain details like request changes, endpoints, and received responses. This feature facilitates effective result tracking and analysis.
With these capabilities, the project provides comprehensive automation for API testing.
